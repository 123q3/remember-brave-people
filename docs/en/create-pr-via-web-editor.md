# Complete the Challenge via Web Editor

To complete this challenge, the simplest way is web editor.

Open [`/heroes.json`](https://github.com/ByteLegendQuest/remember-brave-people/blob/main/heroes.json) in web editor.
If it doesn't pop up, open `Explorer` on the left side and open it:

Scroll down to the bottom.

Add one line in that file and fill it out with your information:

- Your GitHub username: open your GitHub profile page, the username following `github.com/` in the browser address bar.
  For example `torvalds` in `github.com/torvalds`.

- Pick up your favorite color, or use the same as others if you don't know how.
- Find an available coordinate (x,y), otherwise your PR will be rejected. (You don't like your tile overwritten by other people, right?)
  Move your mouse to `Hero Noticeboard`, it shows the coordinate, just pick up **a vacant coordinate**.

Note!!! There is a comma at location ①, but **no comma** at location ②. This is required by [JSON format](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).
If you don't understand, don't worry, we'll master this knowledge in the future study gradually.

Click `Submit Answer` button at left-bottom (you can drag the button to wherever you like):

A bot will check if your answer is correct. If everything goes well, your name will appear in `Hero Noticeboard`.
If there's anything wrong, please start from the beginning again, carefully.
